## CSV Upload Format

Upload a CSV file with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Team_A` | Name of the first team |
| `Team_B` | Name of the second team |
| `Runs_A` | Total runs scored by Team A |
| `Runs_B` | Total runs scored by Team B |
| `Earned_Runs_A` | Earned runs by Team A |
| `Earned_Runs_B` | Earned runs by Team B |
| `Innings_A_Batting` | Innings Team A was at bat |
| `Innings_A_Defense` | Innings Team A was on defense |
| `Innings_B_Batting` | Innings Team B was at bat |
| `Innings_B_Defense` | Innings Team B was on defense |

### Example CSV

```csv
Team_A,Team_B,Runs_A,Runs_B,Earned_Runs_A,Earned_Runs_B,Innings_A_Batting,Innings_A_Defense,Innings_B_Batting,Innings_B_Defense
Tigers,Eagles,5,3,4,2,7,6.2,6.2,7
Eagles,Sharks,2,8,1,6,7,7,7,7
Tigers,Sharks,4,4,3,3,7,7,7,7
```

### Innings Format

- Whole innings: `7`, `6`, `5`
- Innings + 1 out: `7.1` (7⅓ innings)
- Innings + 2 outs: `7.2` (7⅔ innings)

## Tie-Breaking Logic (WBSC Rule C11)

### TQB Formula

```
TQB = (Runs Scored ÷ Innings at Bat) - (Runs Allowed ÷ Innings on Defense)
```

### ER-TQB Formula

```
ER-TQB = (Earned Runs Scored ÷ Innings at Bat) - (Earned Runs Allowed ÷ Innings on Defense)
```

### Hierarchy

1. **Win-Loss Record**: Teams sorted by total wins
2. **Head-to-Head**: For tied teams, check direct matchup results
3. **TQB**: Compare Team Quality Balance values
4. **ER-TQB**: If TQB doesn't resolve ties, use earned runs
5. **Batting Average**: Manual review required
6. **Coin Toss**: Manual execution required
